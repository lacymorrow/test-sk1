# Privacy Policy

- Any additional information you voluntarily provide (which we assume means you're comfortable sharing it)

### 2.2 Authentication Data

We integrate with third-party authentication providers because building our own authentication system would require a level of responsibility we're not prepared to assume.

### 2.3 Usage Data

We collect standard analytics data, which means whatever our analytics providers decide to track this week.
