# Payload CMS

[Payload CMS](https://payloadcms.com) is a self-hosted headless CMS with a powerful admin interface and API. ShipKit integrates Payload CMS for structured content management.

## Configuration

To enable Payload CMS, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a Postgres database set up
2. Add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database
ENABLE_PAYLOAD=true
PAYLOAD_SECRET=randomsecretkey # Used for encrypting passwords and sessions
```

If you need to disable Payload CMS (for example, during development when you don't need it), you can omit the `ENABLE_PAYLOAD` variable or set it to any value other than "true".

### Generate a Secure Secret

You can use the tool below to generate a secure random string for your `PAYLOAD_SECRET`:

<SecretGenerator label="Generate Payload Secret" />

## Content Structure

Payload CMS in ShipKit is configured with the following collections:

- **Pages**: For creating dynamic pages with flexible layouts
- **Media**: For managing images and other media files
- **Users**: For managing admin users

## Creating Content

1. Access the Payload admin at `/cms`
2. Log in with your admin credentials
3. Navigate to the Pages collection
4. Create a new page with a unique slug
5. Add content blocks to build your page
6. Publish the page when ready

## Automatic Data Seeding

ShipKit is configured to automatically seed Payload CMS with initial data when it initializes. This happens only if the collections are empty, ensuring that your existing data is never overwritten.

The seeding process includes:
- RBAC (Roles and Permissions)
- Features
- FAQs
- Testimonials

### Controlling Automatic Seeding

You can control the automatic seeding behavior with the `PAYLOAD_AUTO_SEED` environment variable:

```env
# Disable automatic seeding
PAYLOAD_AUTO_SEED=false
```

By default, automatic seeding is enabled. Set this to `false` if you want to manually control when seeding occurs, such as in production environments.

### Manual Seeding

You can also manually trigger seeding through the admin interface or by using the server action:

```typescript
import { seedCMSAction } from "@/app/(app)/(admin)/admin/cms/actions";

// Seed the CMS with initial data
await seedCMSAction(process.env.PAYLOAD_SECRET);
```

## Accessing Content

Content created in Payload CMS is automatically available at the URL matching its slug:

- A page with slug `about` will be available at `/about`
- A page with slug `products/featured` will be available at `/products/featured`

## Preview Mode

You can preview unpublished content by appending `?preview=true` to the URL when logged into the admin.

## API Access

Payload provides a REST API for programmatic access to your content:

```typescript
// Example: Fetch a page by slug
const page = await payload.find({
  collection: 'pages',
  where: {
    slug: {
      equals: 'about',
    },
  },
});
```
