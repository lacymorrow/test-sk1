# Content Management in ShipKit

ShipKit provides a flexible content management system that allows you to choose the right tool for each use case. The system supports two powerful CMS options:

1. **[Payload CMS](/content-management/payload)** - A self-hosted headless CMS with a powerful admin interface
2. **[Builder.io](/content-management/builder)** - A visual page builder with a drag-and-drop interface

ShipKit implements a unified routing system that allows content to be served from either Payload CMS or Builder.io dynamically.

## Choosing the Right CMS

- **Payload CMS**: Best for structured content like blog posts, product pages, and documentation
- **Builder.io**: Ideal for marketing pages, landing pages, and visually rich content. Supports visual editing and drag-and-drop, as well as some AI features.

## Content Authoring

ShipKit also supports [Markdown and MDX](/content-management/markdown-mdx) for content authoring, which can be used alongside either CMS option.

## Getting Started

To get started with content management in ShipKit, configure your preferred CMS:

```bash
# For Payload CMS
PAYLOAD_SECRET=your_payload_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_database_url

# For Builder.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY=your_builder_api_key
```

See the individual CMS documentation pages for detailed setup instructions.
